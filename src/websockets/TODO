> Handle ws connection in a way that if there is any error, it automatically resubscribes to tick streaming again
> Check the time period selection error. Add more restriction on max DAY for daily charts
> Handle feedNotification messages
	> When the series = compare, ignore this message. Should only be shown for base chart
	> If base chart is delayed, then overlay should also be rendered in delayed fashion
> Review all TODOs

Testing ->
> Candles should show for charts
> Overlay should work
> Tick(on candle chart) should work
> Tick chart should work
> Run it for more than 24 hours and make sure that the chart still works
> Test when we close a chart, is it stopping streaming for that instrument
> Open two charts
	> One with overlay R_25
	> One with base R_25
	> Close base and make sure that the other chart still receives updates
	> Close the other chart and make sure that the streaming has closed for R_25
> Do some adhoc testing to make sure that everything is working fine
