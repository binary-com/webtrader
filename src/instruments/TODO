> Code timer so that any changes in instrument will be reflected
    > Check this every 24 hours
    > The timer should check if any instrument have been removed from the list. If a instrument is not available anymore and client already opened a chart for it, the chart should be removed and client should be notified in a popup saying that this chart is no longer available
    > Inform user that new list of instruments are available for them
        > Highlight and show an arrow of where the instrument menu is and fade the highlight away

> Consider delay amount. If the underlying instrument does not support the time period user is trying to add, they should not be allowed or should be shown a pop up

> The input field should only allow numbers and should be in range 1-100

> 'Select Instrument' action should show an overlay with all instruments menu

> When the instruments menu is shown, it should show loading first until the instruments are all loaded

> When OK is clicked, hand over control to chart module with selected instrument and time period details

> When any of the standard period button is clicked, hand over control to chart module with selected instrument and time period details

> Review TODO comments in code (for this module)
