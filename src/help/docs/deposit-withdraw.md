## Depositing and withdrawing funds


###Do I need to deposit any funds to open an account?

You don't need to deposit any money to open an account, but you need to deposit funds before you can start trading.

###How do I fund my account?

Binary.com offers a range of common deposit and withdrawal methods, from credit and debit cards to bank wires, e-cash and e-wallets.

###Is it possible to deposit the same funds through different payment methods?

Unfortunately, no - funds initially deposited through one payment method must be withdrawn through the same system; funds cannot be transferred to an alternate system for withdrawal. We do offer a wide variety of payment methods, to suit your specific needs and preferences.
