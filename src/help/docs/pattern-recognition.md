## Pattern Recognition

###Two Crows (CDL2CROWS)

Look for a tall white candle in an upward price trend. Following that, a black candle has a body that gaps above the prior candle's body. The last day is another black candle, but this one engulfs the previous bearish candle but closes above first bar's open.

###Three Black Crows (CDL3BLACKCROWS)

A bearish candlestick pattern that is used to predict the reversal of the current uptrend. This pattern consists of three consecutive long-bodied candlesticks that have closed lower than the previous day with each session's open occurring within the body of the previous candle.

###Three Inside Up/Down (CDL3INSIDE)

Price trends downward into the start of the pattern, a tall black candle. Following that, a white candle appears that fits inside the body of the prior candle. This completes the bullish harami candlestick. The final day of the pattern is the confirming candle, a white one that closes above the prior close, which it does. The combination suggests price has reversed trend.

###Three-Line Strike (CDL3LINESTRIKE)

Price forms three black candles, each with lower closes, in a downward price trend. A tall white candle engulfs the price action of the prior three days. The candle acts as a bullish reversal when price breaks out upward, and closes above the top of the candle pattern.

###Three Outside Up/Down (CDL3OUTSIDE)

In a downward price trend, a black candle appears followed by a white candle that opens below the prior body, but it may be difficult to see that from the chart. The white candle closes above the body, too. The last day of the three line candle is another white candle in this example. It shows a higher close.

###Three Stars In The South (CDL3STARSSOUTH)

Look for a tall black candle with a long lower shadow to appear in a downward price trend. The second day should be similar to the first day, but smaller and with a higher low. The last day is a black marubozu that squeezes inside the high-low range of the prior day.

###Three Advancing White Soldiers (CDL3WHITESOLDIERS)
