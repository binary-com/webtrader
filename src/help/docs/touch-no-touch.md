## Touch/No Touch

Choose Touch / No Touch when you want to profit from the market touching or not touching a target any time during the contract period.

1. Choose the market, the price target, the time period, and how much you wish to win.
2. Price the trade.
3. Win 10-1000% on your stake if you are correct. Increase your winning return by choosing a 'Touch' trade, with a price target farther away from the current price.
