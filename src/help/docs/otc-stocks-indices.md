## What are OTC indices and stocks?

Binary.com's OTC Indices and stocks offer the benefit of real-time charts and pricing. Enjoy even more exciting opportunities to trade our featured market indices and stocks through this new real-time offering.

Binary.com's OTC Indices and stocks are sourced from the over-the-counter market and provide you with an alternative means of trading stock indices and stocks - available from sources outside of the centralised exchanges.

Please note that due to their over-the-counter nature, the prices of the OTC Indices and stocks will differ from the prices of the corresponding indices and stocks on centralised exchanges.
