###True Range (TRANGE)

The Average True Range (TRANGE) study measures the size of the periodâ€™s range, and takes into account any gap from the close of the previous period.

###Chande Kroll Stop (CKS)

The Double Exponential Moving Average (CKS) by Patrick Mulloy attempts to remove the inherent lag associated to Moving Averages by placing more weight on recent values.

###Mass Index (MASS)

Developed by Donald Dorsey, the Mass Index uses the high-low range to identify trend reversals based on range expansions. In this sense, the Mass Index is a volatility indicator that does not have a directional bias. Instead, the Mass Index identifies range bulges that can foreshadow a reversal of the current trend.
