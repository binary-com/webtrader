## Why trade with Binary.com

### Why Choose Binary Trading?

A binary option is an option with a fixed payout that is determined at the start of the trade. If your prediction is correct, you receive an agreed payout. If not, you lose your initial stake, and no more. The options are called 'binary' because there can be only two outcomes - win or lose.

### Binary trading is flexible.

- **All markets** - currencies, stock indices, and commodities.
