## Momentum Indicators

###Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was published by J. Welles Wilder. The current price is normalized as a percentage between 0 and 100. The name of this oscillator is misleading because it does not compare the instrument relative to another instrument or set of instruments, but rather represents the current price relative to other recent pieces within the selected lookback window length.

###Rate Of Change (ROC)

The Price Rate-of-Change (ROC) indicator displays the difference between the current price and the price x-time periods ago. The difference can be displayed in either points or as a percentage.

###Williams' %R (WILLR)

Developed by Larry Williams, Williams %R is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. Also referred to as %R, Williams %R reflects the level of the close relative to the highest high for the look-back period.

###Rate Of Change Percentage (ROCP)

The Rate of Change Percentage (ROCP) indicator compares the current price with the previous price from a selected number of periods ago. The current price is divided by the previous price. ROCP does not express as a percentage. This indicator is also commonly known as a momentum indicator.

###Rate Of Change Ratio (ROCR)

The Rate of Change Rate (ROCR) indicator compares the current price with the previous price from a selected number of periods ago. The current price is divided by the previous price. This indicator is also commonly known as a momentum indicator.

###Balance of Power (BOP)

The balance of power (BOP) indicator measures the strength of the bulls vs. bears by assessing the ability of each to push price to an extreme level.

###Bollinger Bands (BBANDS)

Bollinger Bands can be used to measure the highness or lowness of the price relative to previous trades.

###Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)

MACD is a trading indicator used in technical analysis of stock prices.It is supposed to reveal changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend in a stock's price.

###Commodity Channel Index (CCI)

The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is a versatile indicator that can be used to identify a new trend or warn of extreme conditions.

###Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO)

The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) is a momentum oscillator that measures the difference between two moving averages as a percentage of the larger moving average.

###Stochastic Relative Strength Index (STOCHRSI)

The Stochastic Relative Strength Index (STOCHRSI) was developed by Tushar Chande and Stanley Kroll, StochRSI is an oscillator that measures the level of RSI relative to its high-low range over a set time period. StochRSI applies the Stochastics formula to RSI values, instead of price values. This makes it an indicator of an indicator. The result is an oscillator that fluctuates between 0 and 1.

###Momentum (MOM)

The Momentum indicator compares where the current price is in relation to where the price was in the past. How far in the past the comparison is made is up to the technical analysis trader. The calculation of Momentum is quite simple (n is the number of periods the technical trader selects): The current price minus the price n-periods ago

###Aroon (AROON)

Developed by Tushar Chande in 1995, Aroon is an indicator system that determines whether a stock is trending or not and how strong the trend is. There are two separate indicators: Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down. A 25-day Aroon-Up measures the number of days since a 25-day high. A 25-day Aroon-Down measures the number of days since a 25-day low.

###Aroon Oscillator (AROONOSC)

The Aroon Oscillator is the difference between Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down. These two indicators are usually plotted together for easy comparison, but chartists can also view the difference of these two indicators with the Aroon Oscillator. This indicator fluctuates between -100 and +100 with zero as the middle line.

###Coppock Curve (CC)

The indicator is designed for use on a monthly time scale. It is the sum of a 14-month rate of change and 11-month rate of change, smoothed by a 10-period weighted moving average.

###Choppiness Index (CHOP)

The Choppiness Index (CHOP) is an indicator designed to determine if the market is choppy (trading sideways) or not choppy (trading within a trend in either direction). CHOP is not meant to predict future market direction, it is a metric to be used to for defining the market's trendiness only.

###Average Directional Movement Index (ADX)

The Average Directional Movement Index index (ADX) was developed in 1978 by J. Welles Wilder as an indicator of trend strength in a series of prices of a financial instrument ADX will range between 0 and 100. Generally, ADX readings below 20 indicate trend weakness, and readings above 40 indicate trend strength.

###Directional Movement Index (DX)

Directional Movement (DMI) is actually a collection of three separate indicators combined into one. Directional Movement consists of the Average Directional Index (ADX), Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI).

###Average Directional Movement Index Rating (ADXR)

Average Directional Movement Rating quantifies momentum change in the ADX. It is calculated by adding two values of ADX (the current value and a value n periods back), then dividing by two.

###Absolute Price Oscillator (APO)

The Absolute Price Oscillator (APO) is based on the absolute differences between two moving averages of different lengths, a ‘Fast’ and a ‘Slow’ moving average.

###Stochastic (STOCH  )

A technical momentum indicator that compares a security's closing price to its price range over a given time period. The oscillator's sensitivity to market movements can be reduced by adjusting the time period or by taking a moving average of the result.

###Stochastic Fast (STOCHF)

The Fast Stochastic Oscillator is based on George Lane's original formulas for %K and %D. %K in the fast version that appears rather choppy. %D is the 3-day SMA of %K.

###Stochastic Slow (STOCHS)

The Fast Stochastic Oscillator is based on George Lane's original formulas for %K and %D. %K in the fast version that appears rather choppy. %D is the 3-day SMA of %K.

###Ultimate Oscillator (ULTOSC)

A technical indicator invented by Larry Williams that uses the weighted average of three different time periods to reduce the volatility and false transaction signals that are associated with many other indicators that mainly rely on a single time period.

###Least Squares Moving Average (LSMA)

The Least Squares Moving Average first calculates a least squares regression line over the preceding time periods, then projects it forward to the current period. In essence, it calculates what the value would be if the regression line continued.

###Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO)

The CMO indicator is created by calculating the difference between the sum of all recent higher closes and the sum of all recent lower closes and then dividing the result by the sum of all price movement over a given time period. The result is multiplied by 100 to give the -100 to +100 range.
