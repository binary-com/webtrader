## Statistical Functions

###Minimum (MIN)

Minimum price over selected period

###Maximum (MAX)

Maximum price over selected period

###Summation (SUM)

###Standard Deviation (STDDEV)

Standard Deviation is a statistical calculation used to measure the variability. In trading this value is known as volatility. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean, whereas high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values.

###Variance (VAR)

The variance and the closely-related standard deviation are measures of how spread out a distribution is. In other words, they are measures of variability. The variance is computed as the average squared deviation of each number from its mean.
