                    The first three days of the Bullish Ladder Bottom are strong black candlesticks with consecutive lower opens and lower closes. The fourth day is a short black candlestick, but it opens higher and trades higher, leaving a long upper shadow, then closes making a new low. The fifth day is a strong white candlestick that makes a body gap with the fourth day.
