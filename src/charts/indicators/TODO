> The dash style drop down should show proper image style indicating how the dash style would look like
(check any indicator folder for more details)

> Option to modify indicator(another menu under Indicators)

> When chart is refreshed or chart type is changed, it should retain the indicators added on chart

> In overlay chart mode, the tooltip should show price(percent% change) just like highcharts examples
http://www.highcharts.com/stock/demo/compare

> On chart indicator should also be applied to all series in overlay mode

> Some of the indicators like EMA, SMA etc shows Applied to price in line chart. Does not make sense

> Some of the indicators like ATR, RSI, ROC, NATR etc are not asking for appliedTo

> Add a new variable in indicator.json which will indicate whether this indicator could be used in line chart or not 

> Find out a chart/series which could be used to test Two Crows indicator
