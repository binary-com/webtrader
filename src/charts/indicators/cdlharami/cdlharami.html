                    A candlestick chart pattern in which a large candlestick is followed by a smaller candlestick whose body is
                    located within the vertical range of the larger body. In terms of candlestick colors, the bullish harami is
                    a downtrend of negative-colored (black) candlesticks engulfing a small positive (white) candlestick, giving
                    a sign of a reversal of the downward trend.
