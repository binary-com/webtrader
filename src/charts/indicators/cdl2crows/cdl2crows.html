            The Upside Gap Two Crows pattern is a rare candlestick pattern that is similar to the
            evening star pattern and the engulfing pattern, but with a few significant differences.
            Like the Evening Star pattern, the Upside Gap Two Crows pattern is a bearish top reversal
            pattern that consists of three candlesticks. The first candlestick in the pattern must be
            a bullish candlestick with a large real body and must be light in color. This bullish
            candlestick is followed by two smaller bearish candlesticks that almost form an engulfing
            pattern, except that they are both bearish and hence dark in color. The first bearish
            candlestick that follows the bullish candlestick must have an upside gap between its real
            body and the real body of the bullish candlestick, as is the case with the evening star
            pattern. However, the last candlestick in the pattern must open above the real body of the
            middle candlestick and must close below it to completely engulf the real body of the second
            candlestick. Where the upside-gap two crows pattern differs from the evening star pattern is
            in the last candlestick, which need not penetrate and close well into the real body of the
            first candlestick.

            As the upside-gap two crows pattern is a bearish trend reversal pattern, it is only valid if
            it appears in an uptrend. As with most trend reversal patterns, the upside-gap two crows
            pattern is more significant when it appears on or near a trend line or support and
            resistance line.
