                    Kicking patterns on a candlestick chart are formed when there are two marubozu - one white and one black - with a gap between them. Bullish kicking patterns would present as a black or filled candlestick without any wicks (shadows) followed by a gap higher with a white or hollow candlestick that is also without wicks.
