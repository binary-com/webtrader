		            Price trends downward into the start of the pattern, a tall black candle. Following that, 
					a white candle appears that fits inside the body of the prior candle. This completes the 
					bullish harami candlestick. The final day of the pattern is the confirming candle, a white 
					one that closes above the prior close, which it does. The combination suggests price has 
					reversed trend.
