                    A short candle line refers to the short real body of a candlestick which illustrates the trading during the day between the open and the close. It is either white, a short bullish candle, or black, a short bearish candle. Both show trading was confined within a short range, with little price movement and relatively weak pressure. It also could be signaling consolidation.
