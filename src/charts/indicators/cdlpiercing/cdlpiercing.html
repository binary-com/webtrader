                    The piercing pattern is made up of two candlesticks, the first black and the second white.Both
                    candlesticks should have fairly large bodies and the shadows are usually, but not necessarily,
                    small or nonexistent. The white candlestick must open below the previous close and close above
                    the midpoint of the black candlestick's body. A close below the midpoint might qualify as a
                    reversal, but would not be considered as bullish.
