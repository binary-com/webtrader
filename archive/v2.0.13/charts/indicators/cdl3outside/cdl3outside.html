<div class="cdl3outside" title="Three Outside Up/Down (TOUD)"><table width="100%"><tr><td><p>In a downward price trend, a black candle appears followed by a white candle that opens below the prior body, but it may be difficult to see that from the chart. The white candle closes above the body, too. The last day of the three line candle is another white candle in this example. It shows a higher close.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><img src="images/indicators/three_outside_up_down.png" height="25%" width="50%"></td></tr></table></div>
