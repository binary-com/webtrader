# Webtrader ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/binary-com/webtrader.svg?branch=master)

This repository contains HTML, Javascript, CSS, and images for [WebTrader](http://binary-com.github.io/webtrader) website.

## Project goal
The goal of this project is to create a full-screen trading interface for [Binary.com](https://www.binary.com) according to the following design:
![Webtrader](https://banners.binary.com/misc/webtrader-layout.jpg)

## Prerequisites

        * git
        * node JS
        * npm

## How to work with this project

        $ git clone https://github.com/binary-com/webtrader.git
        $ cd webtrader
        $ npm install
        $ npm run build #compiles the project
        $ npm start #Start a local server and serve the compiled files

Running this command will launch local server at http://localhost:9001

Since backend needs an https web address for **oauth app register** if you intend to debug oauth login on localhost,  you need to modify your `/etc/hosts` file. For example the `https://webtrader.local/` token in `src/oauth/app_id.josn` is registered to `https://webtrader.local/` address, you need to do the following in order to use it locally.

*Add this line to your /etc/hosts file.*

        127.0.0.1 webtrader.local

*Use this command to run your local server on https.*

        $ sudo node_modules/.bin/grunt connect:https

*Use this command to watch the files.*

        $ node_modules/.bin/grunt && node_modules/.bin/grunt watch:https

Go to https://webtrader.local:35729 and accept the self signed ssl certificate for grunt livereload.

Now you can debug your app on https://webtrader.local/ locally.

To bump release version, run

        $ npm run major-rel
        or
        $ npm run minor-rel
        or
        $ npm run patch-rel

Every check-in or merge into master will trigger travis-ci build and do a release to production.

Every check-in or merge of PR into development will trigger travis-ci build and do a beta release

#### Translations

Translation related files are in `/translations` folder.
    
  To extract text for translation:

        $ npm run build
        $ cd ./translations
        $ python extract.py
        $ extract.py # extracts string literals from `dist/uncompressed` (from *.html and *.js)
        $ extract.py # for merging `.po` files uses `msgmerge` command line tool.

The tool should be available on linux, if you are on Osx try `brew install gettext && brew link gettext --force`.
to submit text to translators: push to *translation* branch, weblate hook will be triggered.

To see CrowdIn In-Context translations pass querystring `?lang=ach` (obs not for production env)
