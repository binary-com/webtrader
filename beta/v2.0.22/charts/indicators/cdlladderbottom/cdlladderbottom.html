<div class="cdlladderbottom" title="Ladder Bottom (LB)"><table width="100%"><tr><td><p>The first three days of the Bullish Ladder Bottom are strong black candlesticks with consecutive lower opens and lower closes. The fourth day is a short black candlestick, but it opens higher and trades higher, leaving a long upper shadow, then closes making a new low. The fifth day is a strong white candlestick that makes a body gap with the fourth day.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><img src="images/indicators/ladder_bottom.png"></td></tr></table></div>
