<div class="cdl3inside" title="Three Inside Up/Down (TIUD)"><table width="100%"><tr><td><p>Price trends downward into the start of the pattern, a tall black candle. Following that, a white candle appears that fits inside the body of the prior candle. This completes the bullish harami candlestick. The final day of the pattern is the confirming candle, a white one that closes above the prior close, which it does. The combination suggests price has reversed trend.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><img src="images/indicators/three_inside_up_down.png"></td></tr></table></div>
