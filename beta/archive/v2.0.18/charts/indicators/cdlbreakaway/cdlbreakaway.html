<div class="cdlbreakaway" title="Breakaway (BA)"><table width="100%"><tr><td><p>The breakaway pattern begins with a long candle representing the current trend. The following candle is the same color and it gaps away from that first long candle. While the third day’s candle can be either color, it will not show a change in the current trend. The fourth day continues the trend and therefore continues to produce the same color candles. The fifth day however, reverses the trend. Please note that it only opens slightly the opposite of the current trend and it continues in the same direction to where it then closes in the gap area.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><img src="images/indicators/breakaway_pattern.png" height="50%" width="80%"></td></tr></table></div>
