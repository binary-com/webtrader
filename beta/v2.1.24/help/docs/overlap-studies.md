## Overlap Studies

###Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) represents an average of prices, but places more weight on recent prices. The weighting applied to the most recent price depends on the selected period of the moving average. The shorter the period for the EMA, the more weight that will be applied to the most recent price.

###Simple Moving Average (SMA)

The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is calculated by adding the price of an instrument over a number of time periods and then dividing the sum by the number of time periods. The SMA is basically the average price of the given time period, with equal weighting given to the price of each period.

###Weighted Moving Average (WMA)

WMA stands for weighted moving average. It helps to smooth the price curve for better trend identification. It places even greater importance on recent data than the EMA does.

###Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA)

The Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA) by Patrick Mulloy offers a moving average with less lag then traditional exponential moving average.

###Triangular Moving Average (TRIMA)

The Triangular Moving Average (TRIMA) represents an average of prices, but places weight on the middle prices of the time period. The calculations double-smooth the data using a window width that is one-half the length of the series.

###Parabolic SAR (SAR)

The parabolic SAR is calculated almost independently for each trend in the price. When the price is in an uptrend, the SAR emerges below the price and converges upwards towards it. Similarly, on a downtrend, the SAR emerges above the price and converges downwards. At each step within a trend, the SAR is calculated one period in advance.

###Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA)

The Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) by Patrick Mulloy attempts to remove the inherent lag associated to Moving Averages by placing more weight on recent values.

###Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA)

The Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA) Developed by Perry Kaufman, is a moving average designed to account for market noise or volatility. This trend-following indicator can be used to identify the overall trend, time turning points and filter price movements.

###Triple Exponential Moving Average (T3)

The Triple Exponential Moving Average (T3) by Tim Tillson attempts to offers a moving average with better smoothing then traditional exponential moving average.

###Hull Moving Average (HMA)

The Hull Moving Average solves the age old dilemma of making a moving average more responsive to current price activity whilst maintaining curve smoothness. In fact the HMA almost eliminates lag altogether and manages to improve smoothing at the same time.

###Linearly Weighted Moving Average (LWMA)

Like the EMA, the LWMA assigns more meaning to the recent prices and less to the closing price from the period's beginning. Thus they are faster at detecting a trend reversal, though it they can be more prone to market noise.

###Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA)

A Smoothed Moving Average is sort of a blend between a Simple Moving Average and an Exponential Moving Average, only with a longer period applied.

###Mesa Adaptive Moving Average (MAMA)

The MESA Adaptive Moving Average is developed by John Ehlers of Mesa Software. This trend-following indicator can be used to identify the overall trend, time turning points and filter price movements.

###Arnaud Legoux Moving Average (ALMA)

This Moving Average uses curve of the Normal (Gauss) distribution which can be placed by Offset parameter from 0 to 1. This parameter allows regulating the smoothness and high sensitivity of the Moving Average. Sigma is another parameter that is responsible for the shape of the curve coefficients.

###Donchian Channel (DC)

The Donchian Channel is an indicator used in market trading developed by Richard Donchian. It is formed by taking the highest high and the lowest low of the last n periods. The area between the high and the low is the channel for the period chosen.
